# Hybrid ML Models for Healthcare Diagnosis

This repository contains the Python implementation of “Hybrid Machine Learning Models for Healthcare Diagnosis”

The project applies multiple machine learning algorithms to a heart disease dataset in order to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on clinical attributes.

This implementation supports the analysis and results discussed in the final project report submitted as part of the Coursera Capstone – Data Science in Stratified Healthcare and Precision Medicine.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset. The target variable indicates whether a patient has heart disease (binary classification).

The dataset was preprocessed and directly used for exploratory analysis and model training.

**Objective of the Project**

The main objectives of this project are:

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on clinical data

To build and compare multiple machine learning models

To evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid and individual models for healthcare diagnosis

To identify the most suitable model based on performance metrics

**Models Implemented**

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Each model was trained using the same dataset split to ensure fair comparison.

**Methodology Summary**

The overall methodology followed in this project includes:

Loading and understanding the dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations

Feature scaling and data preparation

Training individual machine learning models

Evaluating model performance using standard metrics
